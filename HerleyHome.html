                    Hi, my name is Jake Shedroff.  I am currently in my Sophomore year at The University of Cincinnati.  I am currently studying in the field of Information Technologies.  I am enjoying all of my classes, and learning many new things along the way.  I am currently studying to receive my Bachelor’s degree.  As of right now, I am not sure what I would like to do in the future.  Last semester I was a student in the school of engineering, in the exploratory program.  I took Computer Science 1 and really enjoyed programming ever since!
                </p>
                <p class = "normText">	My interests include: Sailing, Robotics,  radio control  airplanes, and programming.  I have been  sailing for about 6 years.  My mom knew  my dad used to sail when he was younger, and after having gone on a sailing  tour in Hawaii, decided it was a great way to bond as a family.  We shopped around for months trying to find  the perfect boat for our family.  We  found a C&amp;C 24, which fit the bill perfectly.  Her name is Nalu, which means wave in Hawaiian.  As for robotics, which I haven’t been  involved in too long, is very interesting to me.  Last semester, During one of my flying club  meetings, my Professor from computer science 1 walked in, and had joined the  club a few days before.  He was there  trying to find a pilot for the UC robotics team.  They had a project airplane, as well as a quad-copter they needed to be flown.  Ever  since then, I have come to be known as the Radio control expert and pilot for  the team. I have also taken the position as secretary on the team.</p>

                <p class = "normText">Which brings me to the last interest of mine  that I have mentioned.  Flying! I have  been flying radio controlled airplanes for 10 years.  I belong to the Greater Cincinnati Radio  Control club.  I am an instructor, and  enjoy teaching students (including my Professor) how to fly these airplanes.  I can fly just about anything you put in my  hands, and have the respect of my fellow club members (some of which have been  flying 30+ years). I am currently building a Yak 55M with an 89" wingspan, powered by a Desert Aircraft 60CC Gasoline engine. I don't consider myself much of a builder, because it is hard for me to sit down and focus on building. I enjoy flying much more. I have developed my skills over the years, and plan to compete in precision, and freestyle aerobatic competitions in the near future.</p>
